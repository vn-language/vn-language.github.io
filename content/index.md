Vanadium is a robust programming language built with expressiveness and safety in mind. It blends low-level paradigms like manual memory management and bit-sized integers with high-level features, backed by a powerful unsafe system for when full control is needed.

Vanadium gives you what you expect from C++ â€” and then some:

- Interfaces
- `defer` and memory management helpers
- Cleaner lambdas
- Simpler iteration
- Safer (but optional) casting
- Sealed classes
- A real module system
- Compile-time values
- Clean error handling (`try`, `guard`, etc.)
- Implicit type inference (without auto)

All this is packed in a language that prioritizes explicitness, transparency, and power, with a cleaner syntax and better tooling in mind.

Vanadium is fully open-source and non-profit. It is currently being developed in C++.

### Examples:

static func main() {
    println("Hello, World!");
}
```

</details>

<details> 
<summary><strong>Iterate over an array</strong></summary>

```vanadium
from "std/IO" include println;

    let names = ["Jhon", "Tom", "Angela", "Luca"];
    for name in names {
        println("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }
}
```

<details> 
<summary><strong>Unsafe casting</strong></summary>

```vanadium

    let long_int: long = 0xFFFFF;

    @@ Unsafe narrowing cast
    let to_short: short = unsafe { long_int as short };

    unsafe {
        let to_float: float = long_int as float;
    };
}
```

<details> 
<summary><strong>Error handling</strong></summary>

    return a / b unless b == 0 ifso throw new Exception("Can't divide by zero");
}

static func main() {
    let result = try div(5, 0) catch {|err|
        println("Error: " + err);
        return;
    };
    println("Result: " + result);
}

<summary><strong>Create a Vector2 class</strong></summary>
