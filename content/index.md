Vanadium is a strictly typed, high-level systems programming language with **strong memory management**, **strict semantics** and **C interoperability**. Designed as a *stricter but more modern and less painful* alternative of C/C++, Vanadium provides **raw power and performance** with **explicitness and transparency** while also implementing a [**rich standard library**](/ref/) with helpers, macros and abstraction of more complex systems.

```vanadium
include std::io;

frozen fn main() {
    io::print("Hello, World!");
}
```
